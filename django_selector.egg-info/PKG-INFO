Description: django-selector is a custom url pattern parser for Django that is based off of
        `Luke Arno's Selector <http://github.com/lukearno/selector/>`_ for WSGI.  It
        is designed to simplify the writing and reading of url patterns by providing
        recipes for frequently used patterns.  django-selector's parser ignores classic
        regex based url patterns, so if you require the flexibility of regexes you
        needn't jump through registration hoops for a one-off url pattern. Using these
        named patterns in your urls.py clarifies *what* they are matching as well as
        *how* they are matching it::
        
            patterns('foo.views',
            (r'^/(?P<name>[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)/(?P<foos>\d*.?\d+)/$', 'index', {}, 'foo-index'))
        
        becomes::
        
            parser.patterns('foo.views',
            (r'/{name:slug}/{foos:number}/', 'index', {}, 'foo-index'))
        
        You can install django-selector with pip::
        
            pip install django-selector
        
        You can fork django-selector `from its hg repository
        <http://bitbucket.org/jmoiron/django-selector>`_::
        
            hg clone http://bitbucket.org/jmoiron/django-selector
        
        You can also read the full `release documentation 
        <http://packages.python.org/django-selector/>`_.
